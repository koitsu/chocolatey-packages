VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The embedded `tools/HxDSetup.zip` file can be verified by comparing its checksum [1]
against the checksum provided on the vendor's page [2] or by redownloading from there [3].

Note that this verification can only be done if the package's version is still the latest version.
The vendor does not serve older binaries or hashes on his website.
